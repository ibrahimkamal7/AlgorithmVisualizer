# Algorithm Visualizer

### About

This is an algorithm visualizer which can be used to visualize different sorting and searching algoritms.

### Algorithms Implemented

1. Sorting Algorithms

- Bubble Sort
- Heap Sort
- Quick Sort
- Merge Sort

2. Searching Algorithms

- Linear Search
- Binary Search

### Technologies Used

- ReactJS
- HTML
- CSS
- Material-UI

### How to run the visualizer

- Navigate to the root directory of the project.
- Run npm install to install all the modules from package.json
- Run npm start to start the project in development mode
- Browse http://localhost:3000 in the browser to see the visualizer running

### How to use the visualizer

- For sorting visualizer you are required to select atleast one sorting algorithm and then you can click on **_Visualize Algorithms_** button to visualize them
- You **_cannot_** visualize sorting algorithms if the arrays are already sorted
- For searching visualizer, you are required to enter a number to be searched and then you can choose any of the two searching algorithms to visualize.
